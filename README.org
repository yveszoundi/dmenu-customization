#+TITLE: DMENU customization

This is my [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][dmenu]] configuration with /no manual editing required for builds on BSD platforms/.

* Customization

- Patches: [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/border/][border]], [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/center/][center]], [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/xresources/][xresources]]
- Additional =mk= files to allow building transparently on both Linux and BSD (NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD).

* Requirements

The package names vary for depending on the Linux that you're using.

#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt install build-essential \
       libx11-dev \
       libxft-dev \
       libxinerama-dev \
       libfreetype6-dev \
       libfontconfig1-dev
#+end_src
